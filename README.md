# Advanced Anime Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is an **Advanced Anime Recommendation System** designed to provide personalized and accurate recommendations to users based on their natural language inputs. The system leverages **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** and powerful similarity computation techniques, such as **TF-IDF**, **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**, **cosine similarity**, and **transformer-based embeddings**. By combining these approaches, the system can understand user preferences in detail and recommend anime titles effectively.

## Features
1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**
   - Accepts user inputs in plain text (e.g., "Recommend me a romantic anime with strong female characters").
   - Extracts genres, themes, and specific preferences using NLU techniques.

2. **Content-Based Recommendations:**
   - Analyzes anime descriptions, genres, and metadata using **TF-IDF** and **transformer embeddings**.

3. **Collaborative Filtering:**
   - Utilizes **k-NN** to find similar users and recommend anime they liked.

4. **Hybrid Recommendations:**
   - Combines content-based and collaborative approaches for more robust results.

5. **Advanced Similarity Metrics:**
   - Uses **cosine similarity** to compare feature vectors for recommendations.
   - Employs transformer-based sentence embeddings for deep semantic understanding.

## System Workflow
### Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **Dataset Preparation**
- **Source Dataset:**
  - Use datasets like AniList or MyAnimeList to gather anime metadata, user ratings, and reviews.
  - Key features: `Title`, `Genres`, `Synopsis`, `Rating`, `User Reviews`.

- **Preprocessing:**
  - Clean and normalize text data (remove stop words, lowercase conversion).
  - Tokenize anime descriptions and user reviews for NLU analysis.

### 2. **Feature Extraction**
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:**
  - Convert anime descriptions and metadata into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.
  - Captures the importance of words while reducing noise from frequently occurring terms.

- **Transformer-Based Embeddings:**
  - Use models like **BERT** or **Sentence-BERT** to generate semantic embeddings for anime descriptions.
  - These embeddings capture deeper contextual meaning and similarities.

### 3. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**
- Parse user input to extract:
  - **Genres:** Identify keywords like "romance," "action," etc.
  - **Themes:** Recognize preferences (e.g., "strong female lead," "dark tone").
  - **Sentiment:** Understand whether the user is looking for lighthearted or intense anime.

### 4. **Similarity Computation**
- **Cosine Similarity:**
  - Compute cosine similarity between user input vector and anime description vectors.
  - Return top `N` anime with the highest similarity scores.

- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):**
  - Identify similar users based on their ratings and preferences.
  - Recommend anime highly rated by the user's nearest neighbors.

### 5. **Hybrid Recommendations**
- Combine:
  - **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommendations based on similarity between anime metadata and user input.
  - **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommendations based on user-user similarities using k-NN.

- Apply weighting to balance between the two approaches (e.g., 70% content-based, 30% collaborative).

### 6. **User Interface**
- Build a simple, user-friendly web interface for interaction:
  - **Input Box:** Accept natural language queries.
  - **Recommendations Display:** Show anime titles with descriptions, genres, and ratings.

### 7. **Feedback Loop**
- Allow users to rate recommendations.
- Update models dynamically to improve future recommendations (e.g., re-train k-NN or adjust TF-IDF weights).

## Technologies Used
1. **Natural Language Processing:**
   - `spaCy`, `NLTK`, `Transformers (Hugging Face)`.

2. **Vectorization and Embeddings:**
   - `TF-IDF` (from `Scikit-learn`).
   - Transformer-based models (e.g., `BERT`, `Sentence-BERT`).

3. **Similarity Computation:**
   - Cosine similarity (`NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`).
   - k-NN algorithm (`Scikit-learn`).

4. **Frameworks:**
   - Backend: `Flask` or `FastAPI`.
   - Frontend: `React` or `Vue.js`.

5. **Databases:**
   - `SQLite` or `PostgreSQL` for storing anime data and user preferences.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Containerization: `Docker`.
   - Hosting: `AWS`, `Heroku`, or `Google Cloud`.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for frontend development)
- Docker (optional for containerization)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theprashasst/Advanced-Anime-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Advanced-Anime-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   python setup_database.py
   ```

4. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Example Usage
1. **Input:** "Recommend me a sci-fi anime with time travel and a smart protagonist."
2. **Output:**
   - *Steins;Gate*: A time-travel anime with a brilliant protagonist.
   - *Erased*: A suspenseful anime involving time loops.
   - *The Girl Who Leapt Through Time*: A heartwarming take on time travel.

## Future Improvements
- **Cold-Start Problem:**
  - Use transformers for better recommendations when user data is sparse.

- **Explainable AI:**
  - Provide explanations for why specific anime were recommended.

- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - Integrate with live APIs like AniList or MyAnimeList to fetch trending anime.
